## The Problem

When developing multi-agent applications, where you chain multiple LLMs/functions together, making a small change (ex: step 5 of a 10-step process) typically requires rerunning the entire program from the beginning. This is not only time-consuming but also wastes tokens, which become big problems as systems grow more in size.

## The Solution

We've developed a specialized SDK + IDE for multi-agent development that intelligently caches outputs and maps relationships between steps. You still get granular control of your project, and we do the heavy lifting of constructing a call graph between functions.
